      <h1>Welcome to Butter's Blog!</h1>
      <h2>Who's Butter?</h2>
      <p>Frequently utilizing the psuedonym Butter even in real life, she's a bit of an odd person out, preferring to display her individuality in all aspects of her life. While always playing by the rules, Butter likes to put her own touch on everything she does, and in that way aspires to make her life and everything around her the best it can be.</p>

      <p>Butter's many passions include learning, traveling, reading, and loving animals of all kinds. Her profession currently is helping students with disabilities be able to achieve in higher education, but her love for technology is pushing her in the direction of software development, which will likely include working on adaptive technologies for people with disabilities. The knowledge and expertise Butter has gained over her 11 years of experience in disability services will likely be a great help in any future pursuits.</p>

      <h3>Why this blog?</h3>
      <p>Another one of Butter's life-long loves has been writing. She almost received a minor in English during her undergraduate with the amount of writing electives that she took. She has a lot to share about her experiences, so this blog is the perfect way to combine writing and sharing.</p>

      <h2>First Post</h2>
      <p>This blog isn't pretty. To be honest, right now I'm just practicing learning to use div and span tags to style text. Maybe I'll hold onto this to keep refining and making better. I'd love to have a real blog, and one that I designed myself would be kickass.</p>
